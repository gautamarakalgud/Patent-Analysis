    "Academic papers, patents and trademarks are often a very good indication of the direction in which a field of research is evolving. In this project, we aim to procure and analyze millions of patents, published academic work and trademarks. The procured documents must range over a wide period of time (30+ years) and over diverse fields in order give us a sense of how academic research has evolved over time and how inter and cross disciplinary research has grown.\n",

    "- Utilizing public databases of published academic work (such as Google Scholar) to obtain relevant material.\n",

    "**Project Objectives:**\n",
    "- Identify key trends in the development of specific fields of research (eg. Advances in Deep Learning).\n",
    "- Geographical analysis of research output and understanding why different parts of the world are focussed on different fields.\n",
    "- Performing a time analysis on the data to determine the “right time” to publish (great work published too early or too late into the growth of a field are not taken well)."

    "Google scholar is a publicly available and freely accesible search engine for scholarly literature. Here we try to obtain publication data from Google Scholar by developing a querier and parser for Google Scholar output. Although there are open source parsers [[1]](https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py) that do this, it is easier to write a customized parser that parses the information we need. It's classes can be invoked independently or used as a command line tool. Currently the parser implements the full functionality of Scholar's *Advanced Search* option and recursively retrieves the titles of the search outputs. Since Google does not provide the complete abstract in its output, there is no way simple way to parse the complete abstract for all results. The following code run from the command line parses the first 1000 results for a particular query and dumps them into a .pkl file."
